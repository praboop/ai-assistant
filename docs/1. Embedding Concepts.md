# 📚 What is an Embedding?

An **embedding** is a numerical representation of data—usually **text**—that captures its **meaning, context, and semantics** in a way that can be understood and compared by machine learning models.

## 🧠 Plain English

Imagine comparing these two sentences:

- `I want to reset my password.`
- `How do I recover my login credentials?`

They use different words, but **mean something similar**. A text embedding converts each sentence into a vector like this:

```
[0.01, -0.12, 0.33, ..., 0.04]  # A vector of 768 numbers (for example)
```

Once in this vector form, we can measure **how close** or **similar** they are using mathematical distance (e.g., cosine similarity).

## 🔢 Example

| Sentence                        | Embedding (truncated)          |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Reset my password               | [0.12, -0.45, 0.33, ..., 0.04] |
| Recover login credentials       | [0.10, -0.44, 0.35, ..., 0.06] |
| Where can I find my invoice?    | [0.01,  0.20, -0.50, ..., -0.30] |

- The first two embeddings are **similar** → similar meaning  
- The third is **different** → unrelated meaning

## 📌 Why Are Embeddings Useful?

| Use Case            | How Embeddings Help                                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Semantic Search     | Find similar content, even if different words are used  |
| Clustering          | Group related messages into threads or topics           |
| Classification      | Predict labels like "question", "clarification", etc.   |
| Recommendation      | Suggest related FAQs or past conversations              |
| FAISS Search        | Retrieve most similar messages efficiently              |

## 🧰 How They're Generated (In Your Project)

You're using a pretrained **SentenceTransformer** model:

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer("sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2")
embedding = model.encode("your input text here")
```

This produces a vector of 768 floating-point values representing the **semantic meaning** of the input text.

## 🧭 Conceptual Visualization

```
            [Reset password]
                 /
     [Recover login credentials]
               /
       [Forgot PIN]                 [Download invoice]  ← unrelated, far away
```

- Vectors for semantically related messages are **closer together**
- Unrelated messages are **farther apart**

This enables **fast and meaningful similarity search** using tools like **FAISS**.
